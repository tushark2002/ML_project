# Comparative Analysis of Neural Networks for MNIST Digit Recognition

This project compares the performance of various neural network architectures on the MNIST dataset, including:
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)**
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
- **Residual Neural Network (ResNet)**

The analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture in terms of accuracy, training time, and computational efficiency.
